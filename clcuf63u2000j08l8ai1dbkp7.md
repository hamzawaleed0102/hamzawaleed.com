# Master the Art of React Hooks: Top 5 Hooks for Beginners

React Hooks are a powerful new feature in React that allows developers to write functional components with state and lifecycle methods. They were introduced in React 16.8 and have since become the recommended way to write components in React. In this blog post, we will discuss the top 5 React Hooks tips for beginners, including code snippets to help you get started.

**Before we get started, remember,** that hooks should only be called at the top level of your component, not inside loops or conditions. This ensures that the order of hooks is consistent and predictable, making it easier to understand and debug your code. Additionally, make sure that you always pass the same dependencies to hooks that have dependencies, otherwise, it will cause unexpected behaviour or re-renders of your component.

## useState

Use the `useState` Hook for state management. The `useState` hook is the simplest way to add a state to a functional component. It takes an initial value as an argument and returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update it. Here is an example of how to use the `useState` Hook to create a simple counter:

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## useEffect

Use the `useEffect` Hook for lifecycle methods. The `useEffect` Hook allows you to run side-effects (such as fetching data or updating the DOM) in a functional component. It takes a callback function as an argument and runs it after the component has rendered. Here is an example of how to use the `useEffect` Hook to fetch data from an API:

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const DataFetcher = ({ url }) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(url)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, [url]);

  return data ? <div>{data}</div> : <div>Loading...</div>;
}
```

## useMemo

The `useMemo` React hook is a built-in hook that allows a component to optimize the performance of a computed value by ensuring that the value is only recomputed when one of its dependencies has changed.

Here's an example of how to use `useMemo` with arrow functions:

```javascript
import { useState, useMemo } from 'react';

const Child = ({ value }) = >{
  return <p>{value}</p>;
}

const Parent = () => {
  const [value1, setValue1] = useState(0);
  const [value2, setValue2] = useState(1);

  // We define the computed value and its dependencies
  const computedValue = useMemo(() => {
    // This function is only executed if value1 or value2 changes, no other state change can re-execute this function.
    return value1 + value2;
  }, [value1, value2]);

  return (
    <Child value={computedValue} />
  );
}
```

In this example, we're creating a `Parent` component that manages two states `value1` and `value2` and passes a `computedValue` to a `Child` component. The `computedValue` is the sum of `value1` and `value2` states.

We use the `useMemo` hook to ensure that the `computedValue` is only recomputed when `value1` or `value2` changes. This way, the `Child` component will not re-render when the `Parent` component's state changes, unless the `computedValue` is recomputed.

The `useMemo` hook takes two arguments, the first one is a function that returns the computed value, and the second one is an array of dependencies. The function passed to `useMemo` is only executed if any of the values in the dependencies array change.

In this example, the `computedValue` is the sum of value1 and value2 and it's only recomputed when one of these two values changes, this way the child component only re-renders when the `computedValue` changes.

This improves the performance of our application by avoiding unnecessary re-renders of the `Child` component and also it makes our code more readable and easy to maintain.

## useCallback

Use the `useCallback` Hook for performance optimization. The `useCallback` Hook allows you to optimize the performance of your component by avoiding unnecessary re-renders. It takes a callback function and a list of dependencies as arguments and returns a memoized version of the callback that only changes if the dependencies have changed. Here is an example of how to use the `useCallback` Hook to optimize the performance of a component:

```javascript
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const Child = ({ handleClick }) => {
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment</button>;
}

const Parent = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);

  // We define the callback function and its dependencies
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    setValue(value + 1);
  }, [value]);

  return (
    <Child handleClick={handleClick} />
  );
}
```

In this example, we're creating a `Parent` the component that manages a `value` state and passes a `handleClick` callback function to a `Child` component. The `handleClick` function increments the `value` state when invoked.

We use the `useCallback` hook to ensure that the `handleClick` function is only recreated when the `value` state changes. This way, the `Child` component will not re-render when the `Parent` component's state changes, unless the `handleClick` callback is recreated.

This improves the performance of our application by avoiding unnecessary re-renders of the `Child` component.

It's important to note that `useCallback` is similar to `useMemo` hook, but it is used for callbacks, while `useMemo` is used for and values. Use of `useCallback` hook with any functional component will improve the component's performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

It's important to note that the dependencies passed to `useCallback` hook should be the minimal set of values that the callback function depends on, this way the component will only re-render when those dependencies change.

## useContext

Use the `useContext` Hook for context management. The `useContext` React hook is a built-in hook that allows a component to access a context value without having to pass it down through props. This can be particularly useful when working with large or complex component trees, as it allows for a more efficient and organized way to share data between components.

Here's an example of how to use `useContext`:

First, you need to create a context object:

```javascript
// MyContext.js
import { createContext } from 'react';

export const MyContext = createContext();
```

Then, you need to wrap the components that need access to the context value with the `MyContext.Provider` component and pass in the value as a prop.

```javascript
import { MyContext } from './MyContext';

const Parent = () => {
  const value = { name: "John Doe" };

  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={value}>
      <Child />
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

Next, in the child component that needs access to the context value, you can use the `useContext` hook.

```javascript
import { MyContext } from './myContext';

function Child() {
  const contextValue = useContext(MyContext);

  return <p>{contextValue.name}</p>;
}
```

In this example, `Child` the component can access the `name` property of the context value through the `contextValue` variable.

The `useContext` hook can be used in any functional component, it receives the context object as a parameter, and it returns the current context value.

It is important to note that if the context value changes, the component using `useContext` will re-render and receive the updated value, this way component is "subscribed" to the context and will update when the context updates.

It's also important to note that the `useContext` the hook should be used with a Provider component that has been initialized with `createContext()` method, otherwise it will throw an error.

You can also use the `useContext` hook with multiple contexts, in that case, you just call `useContext` multiple times with different contexts, also when using multiple contexts it's important to be careful with the order of `useContext` calls, the last context will override the previous context values if it has the same variable name.

## Conclusion!

In conclusion, React Hooks are a powerful new feature in React that allow developers to write functional components with state and lifecycle methods. By following the tips discussed in this blog post, such as using the `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and `useCallback` Hooks, you can improve the **performance** and **maintainability** of your code.

Keep experimenting with different hooks and use cases to get a better understanding of how they work and how to use them effectively. Happy coding!
