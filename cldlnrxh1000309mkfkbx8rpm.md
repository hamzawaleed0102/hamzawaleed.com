[Jobcase](https://www.jobcase.com/about-us/) is a leading platform for blue-collar workers. Jobcase acquired upward.net, raised over $80 million and became the third-largest online jobs portal. I've developed multiple new features for Jobcase as Sr. Software Engineer at Arbisoft.

My achievements on this project include:

* Led end-to-end implementation and **improved** performance from 20fps to 50+fps
    
* Upgraded React Native from 0.64 to 0.68, resolving several breaking changes
    
* Improved app speed through effective use of memoization.
    
* Implemented a user-connection feature
    
* Streamlined QA with the integration of Detox end-to-end testing and GitLab pipelines using custom runner
